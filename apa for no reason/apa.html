      <h1>Main Page Heading</h1>
      <p>There are words here because I need to fill this with words. Kinda obvious, huh? Need a lot of words though. Would be good to have various paragraphs with a variation of lines and sentences instead of a single short paragraph repeated over and over and over...</p>
      <p>Right now, listening to <i>All You Wanna Do</i> from the musical Six, though I mostly watch it in the form of a Non/Disney <abbr title="music video">MV</abbr>, which might make you laugh, but dammit it's well made.</p>
      <p>Since I need a few links so I can make this more fun, I will now provide some: <a href title="a link">Link a link</a>. How is that? Nice, huh?</p>
      <p>Holy shit, <a title="this leads nowhere" href="#nonexistent-tag">another link</a>!??!?!?!? Wow, I am on a role!</p>
      <p>Gosh, I sure am nice and kind. I made this whole thing simply because I am an angel and want websites to be accessible for ALL! Including people who are too lazy to use the mouse when they're hands are on the keyboard all the time!!</p>
      <p>What, did you think I was gonna go on and on about actual accessibility rights? I am trying my hardest, my dude, but I don't think I should be considered nice because I want more imaginary people to enjoy the imaginary content I'm posting to my site. Not to mention, accessibility just adds a fun aspect to building website&emdash;which is my equivalent to scrapbooking or sketching on a digital and typing based platform. It's just fun.</p>
      <p>I wanted to write some fanfiction here, just for the hell of it, but fuck, it's 6AM and I have class at 12:30, so i really need to get the fuck to sleepin.</p>
