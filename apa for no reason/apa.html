      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>This page is very empty. Just like my soul! Enjoy your stay in this silly project that went nowhere because apparently I just like to make contentless shitty websites. Like decorating an empty sketchbook...</p>
      <p>Like the color scheme? It looks a lot like my Tigger sweater, so I love it. Though maybe it's a little dull, but I don't really like bright colors when I'm reading at night. I do like bright colors in general though. Maybe that's the next thing I should do, just make a new color scheme with bright colors this time and add a button to change the site theme.</p>
      <p>Like AO3?</p>
      <p>I gotta wonder why most sites don't add a swiping feature to their shit so the header doesn't act shitty (aka looks jank, is slow, takes up too much room) but a user can still access the menu by swiping. Though maybe I'm just stupid and most sites do do that.</p>
      <p>I guess it is more accessible to display the navigation upfront and in horizontal form instead of in a hidden button? Or maybe just a best practice overall. Personally don't enjoy it though...</p>
      <p>Most sites are still slow as fuck though. Ugh, I had to travel through the shithole that is HP's website and I'm fairly certain I've been traumatized. Feels like UI should be easier to grasp, we stare at our phones half the day!</p>
      <p>My personal calculator reminds me that I should probably pack a calculator. Takes too much brain power to add and subtract&mdash;it actually takes more brain power than multiplying and dividing, ha. I guess I see more rules in MD than in AS.</p>
      <p>Should I add a 'Skip to Main Content' link uptop? I think it's fine to not in the home page (or all main pages), since the main content is only 2 tabs away from the top. And, assuming this becomes a chapter story keeping site <s>blh, wrds</s>, all the next and previous and table of contents buttons should link to the <a href="#main">correspondingpage.html#main</a> anyway...</p>
      <p>So fucking sleepy, finally, but I have to wake up in an hour and thirty T^T</p>
      <p>Haven't had time for anything fun this weekend. Got invited to the circus and couldn't go, got invited to eat and couldn't go, then my mom came over and yelled at me to clean my room even though my mood had been so good that day, ahhhh....</p>
      <p>I swear to god I was in a good mood...</p>
      <p>Lately I'm just in the worst mood all the time. Bluh, I like isolation more than the next person, but studying all weekend sucks.</p>
