Tsuna sat on a solid gold throne that was obviously too big for him, wearing a matching gold crown, one leg impatiently placed across the other, leaning heavily on an armrest, chin in one hand, and a disgruntled glare aimed at the stone wall. Lambo sat on the armrest opposite him, building a tower with the candy wrapper Tsuna had plucked out of his hair.

Fidget here. Fidget there. Tsuna tapped his toe in the air, an eyebrow twitched, his fingers looked like they were anxious to scratch an itch.

Finally, he brought his hands down violently, grabbing each armrest in annoyance and uncrossing his legs to stomp his feet down.

"This is ridiculous!"

"My castle!" Lambo screamed, watching the considerable amount of wrappers tumble away, victims to Tsuna's gesture. His face reddened and scrunched up. "To-le-rate."

Before Tsuna could even think about feeling guilty, a small foot made impact with the back of his head, knocking him clear off the throne and sending him skidding forward several feet. The figure sat himself down on the throne, much smaller, yet somehow managing to fill it better than Tsuna had.

"Reborn!" The injured party sat up supernaturally fast, looking at the small boy in his seat like he was god and satan in one. He rubbed the ache in his head subconciously, saying, "You're back! How is every&mdash;what are you the queen of England!?"

He was wearing a large fluffy dress and a heavy crown, baring a regal scepter. If one looked past reality, they might see the British flag behind him.

"Ciaossu," Reborn responded, using his scepter to nonchalantly tip Lambo to the floor. "I'm getting into my role, dame-Tsuna. Stop losing your crown."

Tsuna yearned to yell at him that he was the one who kicked it off, but knew better. Instead he looked around, finding the crown had flown further than he had, to the opposite side of the room. He talked and walked.

"What is everyone else doing?" he asked, not bothering to mask his anxiety.

"Just as planned, Hibari and Ryohei have working well as towers. They face the opponents head on without fear."

"Injuries?" Tsuna asked, picking up the crown.

"None. Mukuro and Chrome work well as bishops. As expected, illusions fit the job well."

"Is anyone hurt?"

"No."

"What abou-"

"Gokudera and Yamamoto are working hard as knights. And no, no one has been hurt yet."

Tsuna grimaced, fiddling with the crown in his hands. "Yet."

"If they can't take a few broken bones, they're not suited to be your guardians," Reborn said in the same cold tone he always said stuff like that. Tsuna hated when he said stuff like that.

"Why am I even here," Tsuna groaned, stuffing his hair into the crown. "You trained me until I wanted to die, but I'm not allowed to fight or help, or at least <em>watch</em>."

"If I recall correctly," a new voice entered the conversation, "you two are playing the role of king and queen, right? Hey, how come I didn't get to play a role?"

It was a fifteen year old Lambo, looking like the opposite of his five year old self as he ever does.
